            ## v0.9.0 - First Release
            This is the first public release of the Wallpaper Updater program. ðŸŽ‰

            ### Fixed:
            - ~~url isn't changing from GUI, until restart~~
            - ~~exe always showing returned non-zero exit status 1~~
            - ~~start with Windows not reflecting the correct state upon running the program~~
            - ~~.env being created from exe, still not decided whether to keep or remove from code~~
            - ~~couldn't delete being used by another process~~ (Added delay after setting new wallpaper)
            - ~~rarely failed to delete~~ (Terminated `depotdownloader` before deletion)
            - ~~check interval 30 changing to 300 not working~~ (Config updates now apply correctly)

            ### Known Issues:
            - Even when it's just a collection from people, it shows "fetching from page X" â€” fix this.
            - Wallpaper occasionally not set immediately after download; might require adding a delay.
            - Clicking the "X" button while `depotdownloader` runs still hangs the exe.
            - Remove logic for "last scrape time" created from exe.
            - Untested platforms: macOS, Linux.
